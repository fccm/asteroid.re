Admittedly, some of this code is pretty gnarly (it's my first ReScript program). Feedback and
pull requests are welcome!

Also, if you want to make something similar, the
[canvas2d bindings](https://github.com/tinymce/rescript-webapi) used here were extracted and merged into the
[rescript-webapi](https://github.com/tinymce/rescript-webapi) project.
